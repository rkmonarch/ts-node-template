# SOON Staking Script

A TypeScript script to automatically stake SOON tokens and receive gSOON rewards on BSC (Binance Smart Chain).

## What This Script Does

This script helps you stake your SOON tokens and receive gSOON tokens in return. When you stake SOON, you get gSOON (liquid staking tokens) that earn 33,000% APY rewards. It handles both the token approval and deposit transactions automatically.
